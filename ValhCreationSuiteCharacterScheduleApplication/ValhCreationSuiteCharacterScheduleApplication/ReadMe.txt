How To Operate:

1: Change the Character you are currently working on:
		
		Navigate to the "Change Character" button. Input the identification number of the character whose schedule you wish to change, and 
		click the "Change Character" button. You will notice the statement at the top of the application will have changed to appropriately 
		represent which character you are editing.

2: Change a Character's work animation

		Once you have Changed Character per instructions in step 1, simply click any occupational button ie: farm, monk, etc, 
		and the standard animation which your character is set to carry out during working hours will be changed.

3: Wander Distance 
			
		This is generally set between 3 and 5, as this value is then multiplied later in game to create a reasonable wander distance for 
        periods of time when a character is indoors or working in a small area of space. For characters engaged in hunting, this may be 
		scaled up to be quite larger.

4: Output

		Assign full path and filename.txt in the output field and select change output. This will dictate where the lines of text representing npc
        schedules will be printed. To Utilize the newly created schedules, copy and paste the text into the NPCSchedules.txt located in the Valh saved directory.
